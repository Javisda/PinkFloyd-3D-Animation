<h1 align="center">Pink Floyd The Wall 3D Animation [Unity 2020.3.21f1]</h1>
<p>Video here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=I85Rf2xu7Sg&t</p>

<h2>What is this about?</h2>
<p align="justify">This project is from a project to learn the basics of the 3D animation. But, even tho the goal was to make something simpler, I wanted to go a little bit further. For this approach I have used 3dsMax for modeling, 3dsMax and Mixamo for animations, and finally Unity to make things happen (as a way to continue learning Unity on the fly).</p>
<p align="justify">This project, as the title says, is a Pink Floyd The Wall album based project, where the scenario is created by different references around it. So, u can guess I am a big fan.</p>


<h2>What did I implement?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Modeling of every asset you can see, except the plants for the solids behaviour.</li>
  <li>All the scenario animations. From the spinning school and chrused students to the baking of the wall physics.</li>
  <li>Player animations (flag, walking, phrase & giant teacher). From the point I did these 3 I decided to use mixamo for the rest.</li>
  <li>Hammer walking and destruction animations. Walking animation tried as real as posible like shown in the official video. Here an example video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awktDTuuGlg&t=40s</li>
  <li>Player controll system.</li>
  <li>Random idle & attack animations. Attack animation use animation layers so can be triggered while doing different set of animations (steady, walking or running).</li>
  <li>Simple sounds.</li>
  <li>Usage of morphers to make character say a phrase, also recorded by myself.</li>
  <li>Hammers music adjustable by distance. Unity does this for the user with a option in the music component but this didnt worked for me for some reason so I did implement by code.</li>
  <li>The giant teacher watches at the player if it´s before him.</li>
  <li>2 camera systems. First one is with a cinemachine brain. Second is a hand made with 2 modes. If H pressed, switch among flying a stick to the player camera.</li>
  
  <li>Particle system that follows player to simulate an ash crop falling (a mistborn book reference).</li>
  <li>Custom cloth physics implemented on flag and cape (a mistborn book reference). Custom cloth physics project on my github as well.</li>
  <li>Custom solid physics implemented on students and plants. Custom solid physics project on my github as well.</li>
  
  <li>Video editing of course. Im not into this field so that´s all I tried :)</li>
</ul>
